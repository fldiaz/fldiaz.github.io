I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Finance, I worked in the capital market, as an equity analyst and investment manager.
I also worked in the National Social Security Administrator (ANSES) as a supervisor in the execution of several projects.
I developed a large interest in Data Science and programming and joined ITBA for a Specialized Course in Data Science. I finished this degree in 2019.
Since then, I have been training myself and working on several personal and professional projects.
