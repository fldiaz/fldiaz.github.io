title: Deploy a machine learning model using Flask
---
This web app was developed for a client who needs to estimate how many new releases books is going to sell the first 12 months.
A real dataset including the complete sales data for books published in Argentina across several years has been used.
The trained model is a LGBMRegressor classifier.

Steps:
1. Once you selected the machine learning model, use Python's pickle module to export a file named model.pkl;
2. Folow the instructions on [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-flask);
3. Create a templates folder and design a html form where the user will input all the attribute values and the data will be given the model, based on the training given to the model;
4. Save the model.pkl in the directory;
5. Create a html result file and add to the templates folder;
6. Edit the app.py: import the libraries, then using app=Flask(__name__) create an instance of flask.
@app.route('/') is used to tell flask what url should trigger the function index() and in the function index we use render_template('form.html') to display the script form.html in the browser.
7. After the form is submitted, the form values are stored in variable to_predict_list in the form of dictionary. Convert it into a list of the dictionaryâ€™s values and pass it as an argument to ValuePredictor() function. In this function, we load the model.pkl file and predict the new values and return the result. This result/prediction is then passed as an argument to the template engine with the html page to be displayed.
Remember to import every libraries you use in the model.
